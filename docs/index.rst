Why Graaf?
----------

This project is named after
`Van de Graaf <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_de_Graaff_generator>`_.

Why did you build it?
---------------------

Recently I've built a number of sites backed by AWS API Gateway, and needed a
way to build their static pages, but remain consistent with the templates and
styles of the rest of the site.

Indices and tables
